# About Me

ðŸ§™ðŸ“œ I'm looking for a freelance mission.

I am specialized in full-stack engineering. Lately, I've been building a business to make real-time networked video games, but I'm still doing full-stack development for a living.

## Career

I studied IT at Epitech Paris and also one year in southern California at California State University-San Marcos. In the later, I studied mostly computer science and artificial intelligence.

During my career, I've worked on several projects as a founder, associate or employee of companies.

The most notable projects I've worked on, in chronological order are the following:

- At Atos: I worked on a platform dedicated to the exploitation of big data.
- At Intersec: A similar project, but this time for large French telecommunications companies.
- [Mindup](http://mindup.io/) (co-founder): A social network that allows you to send messages to people around you. We had around 10,000 users, which was good for a first entrepreneurial experience, but far from the goal of making it a sustainable project.
- CodeTown (founder): An interactive online platform that offers coding courses in different programming languages. It failed early.
- Chatel Properties (associate): A real estate company specialized in high-quality goods. It worked and it is still working, but I didn't want to build my career in real estate, so I left the company to take up other challenges.
- [ForestAdmin](https://www.forestadmin.com/): A SaaS that plugs into your database to generate a full-featured admin panel. I worked there as a full-stack engineer for about two years. I touched on everything. This is where I've started to learn how to quickly scale a product with a very high growth rate. The conditions were perfect to live a very nice adventure: the team was nice and we raised 3M$ and 7M$. ForestAdmin started out as part of [eFounder](https://www.efounders.com/), a start-up studio that has created many successful companies such as [Mailjet](https://www.efounders.com/companies/mailjet), [Spendesk](https://www.efounders.com/companies/spendesk), [Front](https://www.efounders.com/companies/front), [Slite](https://www.efounders.com/companies/slite), [Aircall](https://www.efounders.com/companies/aircall) and more. I have worked both as an employee of eFounder and ForestAdmin and knowing this ecosystem made my skills step up a lot.
- BigSeed Studio (founder): I am now working in my own business on my own indie video game. The idea is to alternate between the development of my game and periods of consulting / freelance.

## Skills

### As a Full Stack Engineer / Architect

- **Programming language**:
  - JavaScript (browser & nodejs)

  - Mysql
  - Mongodb
  - Redis
- **ORM/ODM**:
  - SequelizeJs
  - TypeORM
  - Mongoose

I am very interested in event sourcing technology like Kafka. I've never used it in production, but I'm up for the challenge.

I'm a good fit if:

- you want to architect a new system.
- you want to scale an existing system.
- you want some manpower for an existing project.
- you want to establish good coding practices.
- you need to set up continuous integration and continuous delivery.
- you want to implement agile processes for a project.

### As a Video Game Engineer

Programming language: C#, C/C++, Rust

I've used Unity a lot, but also custom-tailored game engine depending on the project. I'm familiar with different aspects of the development of a 2d and 3d video game: general architecture, gfx, physic, gameplay, network programming for real-time games like FPSs, etc.

I've used Rust for about a year on a side project. I enjoy the architecture that emerges from languages with strong rules like Rust and Haskell.

### Other skills

- Haskell:

  I've used Haskell for a few weeks. I've read [Get Programming with Haskell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31338521-get-programming-with-haskell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=NkyykSYulz&rank=1) and I'm now reading [Haskell in Depth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057179-haskell-in-depth?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=sQorv6E9UB&rank=1).

  I see how Haskell robustness (strong static typing, purity, and immutability) can increase productivity in the long run, therefore I would be very interested to use it on a freelance project.

## My manifesto

I adhere to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/).

I discipline myself to be rigorous.

I believe we should use the right tool for the job, not the other way around. This is why we must be able to adapt.

But I also believe that the role of an engineer is to make the best decisions based on a goal and a set of constraints. Therefore, there is no general truth, only compromises. Understanding the constraints is not always easy and it's part of a developer's job, it requires communication and understanding between business teams and developers.

I think that someone passionated in his profession will often add more value than someone who is not. In software engineering, this may mean [10 or 100 times the productivity](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/getting-to-10x-results-what-any-developer-can-learn-from-the-best-54b6c296a5ef).

I believe that great products are made by great teams. One aspect of what makes a great team is the ability to communicate safely. It is healthy to argue and have a strong opinion when we remember that it is to be closer to the goal, not to make the ego right. As a team, we have the same goal: to focus on the result, and when we do, we can grow through conflict.

The traits I think are bad in a team member:

- arrogant
- incompetent
- uncooperative
- unmotivated

The traits I think are good in a team member:

- problem solver
- skilled
- mentor
- learner
- passionate

I think perseverance is a strengh but stubbornness is a weakness.

As a team member, we should think about what we can do to improve others in their work. If everyone does this, the team can multiply its potential.

I believe It is ok to be wrong and we must not fear mistakes, only those who don't try don't make mistakes.

But I believe we also have to take responsibility. This is part of building trust and confidence.

Besides, I believe communication is essential. And I think that's true for any relationship. Most of the issues we can have with each other are due to misunderstandings, lack of empathy, or divergent values, and most of these issues can be resolved through communication. Also, we should not be afraid to speak out because of the fear of conflict, because most of the time there is no real conflict, and when there is, we often come out with a stronger bond. Also, it is very rewarding and valuable to have different opinions.

I believe that the mind is part of the body, so doing exercise is also required to improve our skills. Thus, a clear work-life balance is important.

> Arnaud spent about 6 months with us, and he will be missed. He is a passionate, result-oriented software engineer with the drive of a reckless entrepreneur. Both opinionated and constructive, Arnaud also has a very good sense of humor that comes with consistently high spirits, and I have absolutely no doubt he will succeed in turning his projects into successful products & services.
