# About Me

ðŸ§™ðŸ“œ I'm looking for freelance missions.

I am specialized in fullstack engineering. Lately, I have built a company to make networked real time video games, but I still do full stack development for a living.

## Career

I studied IT at Epitech Paris and also one year in south California at California State University-San Marcos. In the later, I studied mostly computer science and artificial intelligence.

During my career, I've worked on multiple project as founder, associate or employee of the companies.

The most notable projects I've worked on, in chronological order are the following:

- At Atos: I've worked on a platform dedicated to the exploitation of big data.
- At Intersec: A similar project, but this time for the big french telecom companies.
- [Mindup](http://mindup.io/) (co-founder): A social network that allow you to send messages to people around you. We had around 10,000 users, which was nice for a first entrepreneur experience, but far from the goal to make it a sustainable project.
- CodeTown (founder): An online interactive platform that offers coding classes in different programming languages. It failed early.
- Chatel Properties (associate): A real estate company specialized in high quality goods. It worked and it is still working, but I didn't want to build my career in real estate, so I left the company to take up other challenges.
- [ForestAdmin](https://www.forestadmin.com/): A SaaS that plugs to your database to generate a full features admin panel. I worked there as a fullstack engineer for about two years. I touched on everything. It is where I've started to learn how to quickly scale a product with a very high growth rate. The conditions were perfect to live a very nice adventure: the team was perfect and we raised 3M$ and 7M$. ForestAdmin started as part of [eFounder](https://www.efounders.com/) which is a startup studio that created many successful companies like [Mailjet](https://www.efounders.com/companies/mailjet), [Spendesk](https://www.efounders.com/companies/spendesk), [Front](https://www.efounders.com/companies/front), [Slite](https://www.efounders.com/companies/slite), [Aircall](https://www.efounders.com/companies/aircall) and more. I worked both as eFounder and ForestAdmin employee, and knowing this ecosystem made my skills step up a lot.
- BigSeed Studio (founder): I am now working in my own company on my own indie video game. The idea is to alternate between development of my game and consulting / freelancing periods.

## Skills

### As a Full Stack Engineer / Architect

Programming language: Javascript/Typescript (browser & nodejs), Python, Haskell (only few week of real world practice, but I'm very willing to improve this skill)

Database: Postgresql, Mysql, Mongodb, Redis

ORM/ODM: SequelizeJs, TypeORM, Mongoose

Frontend framework/library: React, emberjs, Next.js, GatsbyJs

Web api: REST, GraphQL

PaaS/IaaS: AWS, Heroku, Microsoft Azure

Monitoring service: Datadog, Elastic Stack

CI/CD: Travis, Github, Gitlab

Virtualization & orchestration: Docker, Kubernetes

I'm very interested in event sourcing technology like Kafka. I've never used it in production, but I am ready to take up the challenge.

I'm a good fit if:

- you want to architect a new system.
- you want to scale an existing system.
- you want some work force for a existing project.
- you want to establish good coding practices.
- you need to setup continuous integration.
- you want to setup continuous delivery.
- you want to implement agile processes for a project.

### As a Video Game Engineer

Programming language: C#, C++, Rust

I've used Unity a lot, but also custom tailored game engine depending on the project. I'm familiar with different aspects of the development of a 2d and 3d video game: general architecture, gfx, physic, gameplay, network programming for real time games like FPSs, etc.

I've used Rust for about a year on a side project. I really enjoy the architecture that emerges from languages with strong rules like Rust and Haskell.

### Other skills

- Haskell:

  I've used Haskell for a few week. I've read [Get Programming with Haskell](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31338521-get-programming-with-haskell?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=NkyykSYulz&rank=1) and I'm now reading [Haskell in Depth](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41057179-haskell-in-depth?ac=1&from_search=true&qid=sQorv6E9UB&rank=1).

  I see how Haskell robustness (strong static typing, purity, and immutability) can increase productivity in the long run, therefore I would be very interested to use it on a project.

## My manifesto

I adhere to the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html) and the [Software Craftsmanship Manifesto](https://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/)

I discipline myself to be rigorous.

I believe we should use the right tool for the job, not the other way around. This is why we must be able to adapt.

But I also believe that the role of an engineer is to make the best decisions based on a goal and a set of constraints. Therefore, there is no general truth, only compromises. Understanding the constraints is not always easy and it's plain part of the job of a developer, it requires communication and understanding between business and developer teams.

I think that someone passionated in his profession will often add way more value than someone which is not. In software engineering, this may mean [10 or 100 times the productivity](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/getting-to-10x-results-what-any-developer-can-learn-from-the-best-54b6c296a5ef).

I believe that great products are made by great teams. One aspect of what makes a great team, is the ability to communicate safely. It is healthy to argue and have strong opinion when we remember that it is to be closer to the goal, not to make the ego right. As a team, we have the same goal: to focus on the result, and when we do, we can grow through conflict.

The traits I think are bad in a team member:

- arrogant
- incompetent
- uncooperative
- unmotivated

The traits a value the most in a team member:

- problem solver
- skilled
- mentor
- learner
- passionate

I also value perseverance but not stubbornness.

As a team member, we should think about what we can do to improve others in their work. If everyone does this, the team can multiply its potential.

I believe It is ok to be wrong and we must not fear mistakes, only those who doesn't try doesn't make mistakes.

But I believe we also have to take responsibility. This is part of building trust and confidence from the others.

In addition, I believe communication is essential. And I think that's true for any relationship. Most of the issues we can have with each other are due to misunderstandings, lack of empathy or divergent values, and most of these issues can be resolved through communication. Also, we should not be afraid to speak out because of the fear of conflict, because most of the time there is no real conflict, and when there is, we often come out with a stronger bond. Also, it is very rewarding and valuable to have different opinions.

I believe that the mind is part of the body, so doing exercise is also required to improve our skills. Thus, a clear work-life balance is important.

> Arnaud spent about 6 months with us, and he will be missed. He is a passionate, result-oriented software engineer with the drive of a reckless entrepreneur. Both opinionated and constructive, Arnaud also has a very good sense of humor that comes with consistently high spirits, and I have absolutely no doubt he will succeed in turning his projects into successful products & services.
